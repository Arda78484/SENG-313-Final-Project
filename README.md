# SENG-313-Final-Project

### Information About The Project
This project is created by Arda Çam, Sıla Aksan, Beyza Karadeniz and Ahmet Salutk Buğra Demirel for Algorithms Analysis class of 2024

## Problem 1 
Problem: You are working as a data analyst for an e-commerce platform. Your task is to optimize the product listing by sorting products based on sales volume and user ratings. Implement and compare Merge Sort and Quick Sort algorithms to sort a dataset of product records
To create new datasets simply run dataset_creator
To run program install matplotlib by:
```
pip install matplotlib
```
## Problem 2
Problem: You are a project manager organizing conference sessions. Each session has a fixed start and end time, and no two sessions can overlap. Implement a task scheduling algorithm using a greedy approach to schedule the maximum number of non-overlapping sessions.
```
```
## Problem 3
Problem: You are developing a plagiarism detection tool for a publishing house. Implement a Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm to compare two text documents and identify matching sequences. Extend your implementation to output all possible matching sequences in case of multiple results.
```
```
## Problem 4
Problem: You are building a navigation system for a delivery service. Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest delivery routes in a city represented as a graph. Extend the system to support dynamic route updates, such as adding or removing roads during runtime.
```
```
## Problem 5
Problem: You are working as a network engineer optimizing internet traffic through a data center. Implement the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to calculate the maximum network flow from a source node to a target node.
